# core-os-riscv

An xv6-like operating system in Rust.

This project is originally based on "The Adventures of OS: Making a RISC-V Operating System using Rust",
and is now being made to have an xv6-like structure.

You may browse this repo with [Sourcegraph](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/skyzh/core-os-riscv).

## Build Instructions

### macOS

First of all, install GNU RISC-V tools and QEMU. Python3 is also required to generate some files automatically.

```bash
brew tap riscv/riscv
brew install riscv-tools
brew test riscv-tools
brew install qemu
```

Don't forget to add riscv-tools to PATH.

Then, install Rust and related components.

```bash
cargo default nightly
cargo install cargo-xbuild cargo-binutils
rustup component add rust-src llvm-tools-preview rustfmt
rustup target add riscv64gc-unknown-none-elf
```

Finally you may build and run this project.

```bash
make qemu
```

If you want to use readelf tools, etc., you may install pwntools on macOS.

### Ubuntu

Use Linuxbrew.

## Documentation

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/skyzh/core-os-riscv.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/skyzh/core-os-riscv)
<small>(documentation automatically built with travis)</small>

Documentation of this repo is automatically built and deployed with Travis. You may view online version 
[here](https://skyzh.github.io/core-os-riscv/kernel/), 
syscall specification [here](https://skyzh.github.io/core-os-riscv/user/syscall/index.html).

```bash
make && make docs
```

I'll continuously add Rust-specific implementations and how I made this project into documentation.

## Roadmap

**Update** I haven't maintained this project for a while, as I'm busy with my course-works. The long-term plan of this project is that, I'll leverage Rust async features to schedule kernel threads, therefore eliminating the need of sleeplock.

The main goal of this project is to make an xv6-like operating system with the Rust programming language.
And then, I'll separate arch-dependent part and make it into an OS supporting multiple architecture and
multiple boards.
